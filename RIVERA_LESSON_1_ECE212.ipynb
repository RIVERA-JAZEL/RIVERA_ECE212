Python upholds modules and bundles, which encourages program particularity and code reuse. The Python translator and the broad standard library are accessible in source or paired structure without charge for every single significant stage, and can be uninhibitedly disseminated\n\n   So in this lesson, this coursepack will show us how to comprehend and make program in Python. Understanding computer programs requires algorithmic, unthinking reasoning. In this way, understanding computer codes includes a great deal of mental recreation of what will really occur, not what you wish would happen. This additionally requires innovative critical thinking, this implies the capacity to plan, ponder arrangements, and express it unmistakably and precisely."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Activity"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.) Why do you think understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today especially in the new normal?\n    \n   I think understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today especially in the new normal as Steve Jobs once said, \"Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.\" Computer programing is a massively adaptable tool that you can use to do stunning things that are generally either manual and laborsome or are simply outlandish. Computer programming makes things easier for us, by coding it develops structured and creative thinking, and by learning programs it teaches us to be persistent. Especially in this new normal stage of life, programming is kind the relevant to all of us. Since we are limited to do things outside our premises, we tend to compromise it by using our digital gadgets. In this new phase, we tend to learn courses online and think creatively on making our online life associating and exciting.\n   \n2.) If you were able to learn computer program, what program will you code? Why?\n\n   If I were able to learn computer program, i think I'll stick on learning python. As it was said that Python language is not only a high-level programming language but is also versatile and it is also being taught at the moment.\n   \n3.) What would be your pirmary motivation in learning programmingm?\n\n   My primary motivation would be this will help us a lot in assessing our carrer in the future. Aside from that, this new normal situaion could also help in encouraging on facing activities that deals on computers."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Application"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Ask Yourself:\n\n1.) Why do you think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing?\n\n  Programming languages have been around for quite a while, and reliably watches the dispatch of another languages profoundly inspiring designers. Python is rapidly rising to the front line of the most mainstream programming languages in the world and its extraordinary development is unmistakably appeared on Stock Overflow than other programming languages. Why Python? Writing Python code is simple which rates up improvement aside from that reading Python code is likewise natural. Above all, Python also gives us attempted and tried adaptability. This makes Python affirmation one of the most searched in the wake of programming accreditations.\n\n2.) If Python can build anything, where do you think Python is not applicable for?\n\nIn spite of the fact that Python can build anything, there are likewise a few weaknesses. Python has moderate execution speed, which implies it works with a interpreter, and not with a compiler. Python executes more slow than C, C++, Java and numerous different languages. Second, it has huge memory utilization, subsequently it isn't reasonable to use for improvement under restricted memory limitation. Third, it isn't reasonable for Mobile and Game improvement because of the utilization of more memory and its moderate handling speed contrasted with other programming dialects. Lastly, it is hard to test, since it is a interpreter based language, it is difficult to run tests on code written in Python.\n   "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exercises"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercise 1: Mailing Address (Solved, 9 Lines)\n\nCreate a program that displays your name and complete mailing addresss.
